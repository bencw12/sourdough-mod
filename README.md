# Bencw12's Sourdough Mod
Adds the sourdough food item to Minecraft 1.12.2

Features:

  - Create a Tier 1 Sourdough Starter by placing wheat and sugar in a Jar, and begin the fermenting process by adding a bottle of water, or any potion to apply a potion effect to the sourdough.
  - Create a Tier 2 and Tier 3 Sourdough Starter by fermenting Tier 1 and Tier 2 Sourdough Starters, respectively, with nether wart and chorus fruit, respectively.
  - Right click with a Sourdough Starter onto a cutting board to place it on the cutting board, and with a sword, right click to cut a maximum of 4 pieces of Sourdough from the starter, or cut less than 4 pieces and pick the starter back up from the cutting board by right clicking with an empty Jar, and regenerate the starter back to its maximum pieces of sourdough.
  - Cook a sliced piece of Sourdough in the Bread Oven by adding a maximum of four logs, adding the Sourdough, and right clicking with a flint and steel to light the logs.
  - Cooked Sourdough heals a large amount of hunger and saturation (increasing with every tier) and applies a potion effect to the player, so the reward is worth the wait!
  
Enjoy!!
